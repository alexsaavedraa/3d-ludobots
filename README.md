# 3d-ludobots, NOW EVOLVING!


generates shambling almagamations using this code. run using snakes.bat evolve using search.bat

THIS IS BASED OFF OF WWW.reddit.com/R/LUDOBOTS. LARGE PORTIONS OF THIS CODEBASE ARE DIRECTLY TAKEN FROM THE SUBREDDIT. 

This shows the fitness plotted against the generation (x axis)

Here we generate a 3d ludobot and corresponding brain. The pictured diagram shows the first steps of generating, with green being a sensor and blue being a normal cube:

The first step starts with the head block, with ID of one.
The second step randomly chooses a face, then attatches a block to it. 
Each next step chooses a face from all available faces and attatches a block to it. A face is available if it has no other blocks attatched. this process is repeated until the number of blocks specified is reached.

This image shows how the brain is created. red circles are sensor neurons, dark red lines are motor neurons, and pink/purple lines are synapses.
